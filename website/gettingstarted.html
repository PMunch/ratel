          <h2>Getting started</h2>
          <p>Getting started with Ratel is fairly simply. First you need to have <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> installed along with the toolchain for
          the controller you want to compile for. This guide is written with the Arduino Uno in mind, so for that board this would be the AVR toolchain. If you
          have written code for Arduino before chances are good you already have these tools installed. Once that is done you need to install
          Ratel itself:</p>
          <pre><code>nimble install ratel</code></pre>
          <p>If your board is not included in the official distribution you need to grab support for that as well. You should be able to search for all Ratel
          based packages in the <a href="https://nimble.directory/search?query=ratel">package directory</a>. In order to compile and build for your board you
          will also need the toolchain to compile C code and upload that to your board as well. The details of this should be found with the board support
          library.</p>

          <p>Once you have Ratel and your board support installed you need to set up your project. In this tutorial we'll be building for an Arduino Uno, but
          this process is pretty much the same no matter the board. Simply create a <code>config.nims</code> file in your folder with the content:</p>

            <pre><code><span class="Keyword">import</span> <span class="Identifier">boardConf</span>
<span class="Identifier">board</span> <span class="StringLit">&quot;unor3&quot;</span>

<span class="Operator">--</span><span class="Identifier">avr</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">any</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">gcc</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">path</span><span class="Operator">:</span> <span class="StringLit">&quot;/usr/bin&quot;</span>

          <p>This does a couple of things, starting with including the <code>boardConf</code> module from Ratel. Then it calls <code>board</code> which tells
          Ratel that the board we want to build for is the Arduino Uno rev. 3. This will automatically include a set of sane defaults for compiling for this
          micro-controller, along with some procedures that we'll get back to later.</p>

          <p>The last three lines are simply telling Nim where to find the specific compiler we need to use for the CPU/OS combination we're using.
          These could also be placed in your <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/nimc.html#compiler-usage-configuration-files">global configuration</a>
          as they will only be applied when compiling for these platforms.</p>

          <h3>Writing our code</h3>
          <p>Now that our project is all set up we need to write some code, the sample from the front page is a good start. Simply save the following code in
          a file with the <code>.nim</code> extension named the same as the folder it's in.</p>
          <pre><code><span class="Keyword">import</span> <span class="Identifier">board</span>
<span class="Keyword">import</span> <span class="Identifier">board</span> <span class="Operator">/</span> <span class="ImportPunctuation">[</span><span class="Identifier">times</span><span class="Punctuation">,</span> <span class="Identifier">serial</span><span class="Punctuation">,</span> <span class="Identifier">progmem</span><span class="ImportPunctuation">]</span>

<span class="Identifier">Serial</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">init</span><span class="Punctuation">(</span><span class="DecNumber">9600</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">Hz</span><span class="Punctuation">)</span>
<span class="Identifier">Serial</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">send</span> <span class="RawData">p&quot;Hello world\n&quot;</span>
<span class="Identifier">Led</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">output</span><span class="Punctuation">(</span><span class="Punctuation">)</span>

<span class="SpecialKeyword">while</span> <span class="Bool">true</span><span class="Punctuation">:</span>
  <span class="Identifier">Led</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">high</span><span class="Punctuation">(</span><span class="Punctuation">)</span>
  <span class="Identifier">Serial</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">send</span> <span class="RawData">p&quot;Led is on\n&quot;</span>
  <span class="Identifier">delayMs</span><span class="Punctuation">(</span><span class="DecNumber">1000</span><span class="Punctuation">)</span>
  <span class="Identifier">Led</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">low</span><span class="Punctuation">(</span><span class="Punctuation">)</span>
  <span class="Identifier">Serial</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="Identifier">send</span> <span class="RawData">p&quot;Led is off\n&quot;</span>
  <span class="Identifier">delayMs</span><span class="Punctuation">(</span><span class="DecNumber">1000</span><span class="Punctuation">)</span></code></pre>

          <p>To write your own code have a browse through the documentation and check out any Ratel modules in Nimble.</p>

          <h3>Compiling and uploading</h3>
          <p>With the project set up and the code written it is time to compile. When we imported the board configuration earlier we got some tasks for doing
          this loaded into our configuration. To run these we use the <code>ratel</code> binary. So to build simply run:</p>

          <pre><code>ratel build</code></pre>

          <p>If you missed the sentence earlier about putting your file in a folder of the same name this will fail, but fret not, simply pass the file to
          build with the <code>-f</code> flag. This command should have created a binary file in the same folder with the same name as your file but without
          the extension. In order to check how big the resulting binary is we can simply run:</p>

          <pre><code>ratel size</code></pre>

          <p>Or if you're of the curious kind:</p>

          <pre><code>ratel sizeDetails</code></pre>

          <p>The size breakdown you get from this should be familiar to you if you have done any kind of programming with Arduino, it's the same one which is
          written out in the terminal before uploading. It should look something like this:</p>

          <pre><code>AVR Memory Usage
----------------
Device: atmega328p

Program:     298 bytes (0.9% Full)
(.text + .data + .bootloader)

Data:          0 bytes (0.0% Full)
(.data + .bss + .noinit)</code></pre>

          <p>Now the final step of the process is to upload our code to the controller. You can of course do this manually with <code>avrdude</code> but Ratel
          comes with a task for this as well:</p>

          <pre><code>ratel upload --device=/dev/ttyACM0</code></pre>

          <p>For me the board is connected to the USB port at <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> but this might be different for you.</p>

          <p>And that should be it! Your board should now be flashing an LED and printing to the serial terminal. To view the output you can either use the
          serial terminal that comes with Arduino if you have that installed, or you can use a number of terminal applications. The easiest might even be to run
          <code>tail -f /dev/ttyACM0</code>.</p>
