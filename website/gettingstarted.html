          <h2>Getting started</h2>
          <p>Getting started with Ratel is fairly simply. First you need to have <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> installed along with the toolchain for
          the controller you want to compile for. This guide is written with the Arduino Uno in mind, so for that board this would be the AVR toolchain. If you
          have written code for Arduino before chances are good you already have these tools installed. Once that is done you need to install
          Ratel itself:</p>
          <pre><code>nimble install ratel</code></pre>
          <p>If your board is not included in the official distribution you need to grab support for that as well. You should be able to search for all Ratel
          based packages in the <a href="https://nimble.directory/search?query=ratel">package directory</a>. In order to compile and build for your board you
          will also need the toolchain to compile C code and upload that to your board as well. The details of this should be found with the board support
          library.</p>

          <p>Once you have Ratel and your board support installed you need to set up your project. It's a little bit of manual work for the time being, but
          this should improve in the future. First you need a configuration file to let <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/nimc.html#nim-for-embedded-systems">
            Nim know that we're building for a microcontroller</a>. In this tutorial
          we'll be building for an Arduino Uno, but these steps should be mostly the same no matter the board.</p>

            <pre><code>cpu = "avr"
os = "any"
define = "noSignalHandler"

gc = "arc"
define = "useMalloc"

opt = "size"
exceptions = "goto"

noMain
define = "board:unor3"

avr.any.gcc.path = "/usr/bin"
avr.any.gcc.exe = "avr-gcc"
avr.any.gcc.linkerexe = "avr-gcc"
</code></pre>

          <p>This does a couple of things, <code>cpu = "avr"</code> tells the compiler about our architecture, such as the size of a pointer.
          <code>os = "any"</code> makes sure that Nim doesn't depend on any OS specific features and only relies on the standard
          <code>stdlib</code> and <code>stdio</code> libraries. The <code>define = "noSignalHandler"</code> switch overrides Nims default
          behaviour of attaching signal handlers to create better stack traces in the case of segfaults and such.</p>

          <p><code>gc = "arc"</code> turns on the new automatic reference counting algorithm for the garbage collector. If you
          don't use any garbage collected memory this won't generate any code, and even if you do it's nice and efficient.
          <code>define = "useMalloc"</code> configures Nim to only use the standard C <code>malloc</code> and friends memory handling calls.</p>

          <p><code>opt = "size"</code>, and <code>exceptions = "goto"</code> are simply features of the Nim compiler which creates smaller code.
          These are really optional.</p>

          <p>We will also define our own <code>main</code> procedure so we pass <code>noMain</code> to stop Nim from creating one. And then
          the only part of this definition which is Ratel related, namely the <code>define = "board:unor3"</code> which tells Ratel that the
          board we want to build for is the Arduino Uno rev. 3.</p>

          <p>The last three lines are simply telling Nim where to find the specific compiler we need to use for the CPU/OS combination we're using.
          These could also be placed in your <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/nimc.html#compiler-usage-configuration-files">global configuration</a>
          as they will only be applied when compiling for these platforms</p>

          <h3>Writing our code</h3>
          <p>Now that our project is all set up we need to write some code, the sample from the front page is a good start. Simply save the following code in
          a file with the <code>.nim</code> extension.</p>
          <pre><code><span class="Keyword">import</span> <span class="Identifier">board</span>

    <span class="Identifier">delayMs</span><span class="Punctuation">(</span><span class="DecNumber">1000</span><span class="Punctuation">)</span></code></pre>

          <p>To write your own code have a browse through the documentation and check out any Ratel modules in Nimble.</p>

          <h3>Compiling and uploading</h3>
          <p>With the project set up and the code written it is time to compile. There is currently a bug which doesn't allow <code>os = "any"</code> to work
          properly from within the configuration file we created earlier, and there isn't much use for building with debug symbols and runtime overflow checks
          and such on this kind of controller. So to build our program simply run:</p>

          <pre><code>nim c -d:danger --os:any &lt;name of your file&gt;</code></pre>

          <p>This should have created a binary file in the same folder with the same name as your file but without the extension. The AVR toolchain comes with
          a couple handy tools, such as <code>avr-size</code> which we can run to check the size our program will take on the controller. For the Arduino Uno
          which uses the ATMega 328p controller the command for that would look like this:</p>

          <pre><code>avr-size -C --mcu=atmega328p &lt;name of your binary&gt;</code></pre>

          <p>The size breakdown you get from this should be familiar to you if you have done any kind of programming with Arduino, it's the same one which is
          written out in the terminal before uploading. It should look something like this:</p>

          <pre><code>AVR Memory Usage
----------------
Device: atmega328p

Program:     304 bytes (0.9% Full)
(.text + .data + .bootloader)

Data:          0 bytes (0.0% Full)
(.data + .bss + .noinit)</code></pre>

          <p>Now the final step of the process is to upload our code to the controller. This can be achieved by using another program installed by the
          toolchain called <code>avrdude</code>. There are a lot of options that can be passed to this tool, and a lot of resources explaining what they all do,
          so I won't go into detail about that here. Suffice to say that to upload our binary we can use a command like this one:</p>

          <pre><code>avrdude -F -V -c arduino -p atmega328p -P /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 -U flash:w:&lt;name of your binary&gt;:e</code></pre>

          <p>The only parameter you really should have to change here is the port at which your board is located. For me it's <code>/dev/ttyACM0</code> but this
          might be different for you.</p>

          <p>And that should be it! Your board should now be flashing an LED and printing to the serial terminal. To view the output you can either use the
          serial terminal that comes with Arduino if you have that installed, or you can use a number of terminal applications. The easiest might even be to run
          <code>tail -f /dev/ttyACM0</code>.</p>
